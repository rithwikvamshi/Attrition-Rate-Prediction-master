# Attrition Rate Prediction
Customer Churn(attrition) is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate. It shows the loss of clients or customers. 
Our objective is to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the attrition of future customers so that it would be helpful to the companies to find the customers who are more likely to unsubscribe from a service that helps the company to retain them rather than losing.
